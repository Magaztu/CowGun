# CowGun - ML and Video based minigame

As of now:

Web and ML based game about shooting as fast as you hear the "FUEGO!" audio cue.

This minigame is based on 1, 2 Switch's "Fake Trigger" minigame.
The ML model used is PoseModel from Tensorflow.js.

The game will automatically tell if you're on the right or left side  of the screen, asigning a Player 1/2 tag accordingly.

It also runs without any local dependencies. As long as internet connection is available, it will work.
