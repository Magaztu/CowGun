# CowGun - ML and Video based minigame

Web and ML based game about shooting as fast as you hear the "FUEGO!" audio cue.

This minigame is based on 1, 2 Switch's "Fake Trigger" minigame.
The ML model used is PoseModel from Tensorflow.js.

The game will automatically tell if you're on the right or left side  of the screen, asigning a Player 1/2 tag accordingly.

It also runs without any local dependencies. As long as internet connection is available, it will work.

Maybe I'll add a single-player mode later, about shooting vile enemies or perhaps a infinite mode for practicing your (FUEGO!) cue reaction.

This release is still a beta, so it needs tweaks.

I've learned a lot with this project! Mostly how to use Tensorflow.js and applying actual mathematical logic into my code. Even if it's for recreational purposes.

Also how to give a good presentation to the user (UX), drawing on a canvas, and a whole lot other stuff about JS like timeouts, time loops with setInterval(), DOM manipulation, etc.

I will update this README.md with a more professional look later on.

# Gamemodes:
This project features (or plans to) the following modes:
- Single-player (PvE) mode: Win agains a horde of PNGs cowboys!
- Two-Players (PvP) mode: Face each other in an epic 1v1 and see who shoots frist!
- No Hat (No cap) mode: There will not be fake cues, prepare to showoff your ultimate reaction skills!

- Online mode: I will add it when I figure it out.
- Infinite mode: Non-stop cues, let's see how that score grows!

# Deployment:
A web deployment is on the way, it might be on github pages, cloudflare pages or vercel. Most likely the last one.
